# iBrain Code Next

Welcome to the iBrain Code Next project repository! This project aims to revolutionize the way developers interact with their codebase using AI-driven tools, offering a multi-dimensional, scale-based approach to code analysis, refactoring, and optimization.

## Project

iBrain Code Next introduces a suite of innovative tools and methodologies that leverage advanced AI techniques to facilitate more intuitive and efficient codebase interactions. Through a combination of virtual repo representations, scale-based algorithms, and user-friendly interfaces, we aim to enhance the developer experience, streamline workflows, and elevate the quality of codebases everywhere.
