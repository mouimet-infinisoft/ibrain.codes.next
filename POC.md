# Proof of Concept (PoC) for iBrain Code Next

**Objective**: 
To demonstrate the viability and effectiveness of iBrain Code Next's core components in modern software development, especially in the realms of code representation, content vectorization, and scale-based planning algorithms.

---

## 1. Goals:

- **Graphical Representation**: Establish an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)-based graph representation of a sample codebase, showcasing the relationships and dependencies between files, classes, functions, and other code entities.
  
- **Vector Content Storage**: Store code content and relevant metadata in a vectorial database, facilitating efficient Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) interactions.

- **Scale-Based Planning Algorithm**: Implement and test the initial version of the scale-based planning algorithm, focusing on the macro, meso, and micro scopes of the codebase to evaluate potential refactoring impacts.

---

## 2. Components in Scope:

### a. AST-based Graph Representation:
- Convert a sample codebase into its AST form.
- Extract nodes and edges to create a graph showcasing the relationships within the code.
- Visualize this graph for easy human comprehension and verification.

### b. Vectorial Database for NLU and RAG QnA:
- Process the sample codebase and its metadata to generate vector representations.
- Store these vectors in a specialized database.
- Demonstrate basic NLU queries and RAG interactions on this database.

### c. Scale-Based Refactoring/Implementing Algorithm:
- Implement the hierarchical approach, breaking down the refactoring process across macro, meso, and micro scopes.
- Demonstrate this algorithm's efficacy on a specific refactoring task in the sample codebase.

## 3. Use Case for PoC:

**Refactoring a Codebase for Single Responsibility and Logical File Structuring**:

- **Scenario**: The sample codebase contains multiple files with functions handling multiple responsibilities and exceeding logical lengths. The goal is to refactor the entire codebase to align with the best practice of single function responsibilities, logically structured files limited to 50 lines of code, and comprehensive documentation for each function and module.

- **Implementation**:
    - **Macro Scope**: Evaluate the overall architecture of the codebase, identifying modules or files that are particularly long or cluttered with multifunctional methods. Understand the broader interactions between these modules and the rest of the system.
    - **Meso Scope**: Drill down into the identified modules, breaking apart functions or methods that handle multiple responsibilities. This might involve creating new functions or even new modules to ensure each function aligns with the single responsibility principle.
    - **Micro Scope**: For each newly created or refactored function, ensure the code is concise, doesn't exceed the 50-line limit, and is logically structured. Additionally, draft comprehensive documentation, including function purpose, parameters, return values, and potential exceptions or edge cases.
  
- **Expected Outcome**: A refactored codebase where every module and function strictly adheres to the single responsibility principle. Files are logically structured, not exceeding 50 lines, and every piece of code is accompanied by clear, concise documentation. The refactoring should ensure that the overall functionality of the system remains intact while enhancing code readability, maintainability, and scalability.

## 4. Deliverables:

- A documented graph representation of the sample codebase.
- A functional vectorial database containing the sample codebase content, with a demonstration interface for NLU and RAG interactions.
- A refactored version of the codebase, achieved using the scale-based refactoring algorithm, with detailed documentation explaining the steps and considerations at each scope level.

---

## 5. Evaluation Criteria:

- Accuracy and comprehensiveness of the graph representation.
- Efficiency and relevance of NLU and RAG interactions on the vectorial database.
- Success of the refactoring task based on functionality, code quality, and alignment with best practices.
